Mich's telegraph news blog started as a normal gossip tabloid in 2014 by Mr. Eli Eko in Lagos. But later shifted its focus to something deeper and better than a handful of rumors on celebrities lifestyle. Eli Eko launched Mich's blog in his bedroom in the middle of a cold and lonely night of October. And that simple yet mighty action of pressing the launch button took him and Mich's Telegraph on a wild goose chase, a journey into the mythical land of Neverland where he met with Peter Paniski, a rendezvous  in Wonderland with Ms. MAlice and back to Realityland. He never stops boasting of the adventures and has no regret that he started this project whatsoever because this blog has won numerous awards and has seen different recognition as an outstanding and most valued blog in Nigeria interms of diverse content, legitimacy of news and stories featured, informative and education.       
    </p>
        
        <p>
The flame of this blog has almost been quenched many times by evil and ruthless enemies of the press, those afraid of freedom of speech and those allergic to the truth, but due to Eli Eko's intelligence, integrity, agility, fighting spirit and sheer stubborness this good news blog has survived it all like an old ship braving turbulent waters in the middle of the ocean though battered by heavy storm and wicked sea waves.     
    </p>
        
    <p>
Mich's telegraph boasts of over 5 million daily visitors who come on a daily basis for the rich and legit content we offer in the form of news, sports, politics, education, celebrity news, food, travels, science, technology and innovation.
