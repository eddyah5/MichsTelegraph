    </aside>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants. Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium. As a small settlement town in the heart of ancient English land. Today, it is one of the most popular city in the world. It's amazing how the city comes to live at night, almost never sleeps even after a long day of business-in-business-out routine. Walking through the street of London is therapeutic, it has the special benefits of human noise, connection and aroma of food in the air so next time you visit this old city, just do yourself a favour, take a walk.
